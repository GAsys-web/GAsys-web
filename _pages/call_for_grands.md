- As a special feature of GASys, we invite the community to present grand challenges in all areas of Generative AI systems, which are fundamental open issues that require significant long-term efforts from both academia and industry.
- The goal is to stimulate in-depth discussions/debates that focus on long-term technological trends and key areas for future research, and align the visions of various stakeholders for better synergy.
- A special session at next year's GASys workshop may be dedicated to solution proposals for the challenges presented this year.


### Requirements

- All submissions must be original and not under review elsewhere.
- Submissions should clearly articulate the problem being addressed, the proposed solution, and its relevance to generative AI systems.

#### Presentation:

- In-person talks are required. Remote presentations will not be accommodated.
- Submitting to GASys implies strict adherence to this policy. Accepted papers/grand challenges without any in-person presentation will be removed from the workshop program.
