### Grand challenges and Open Problems

- 2-page submissions outlining significant challenges or open problems in Generative AI systems.
- The goal is to stimulate discussion and identify key areas for future research.
- A special session at next year's workshop will be dedicated to solution proposals for the challenges presented this year.

### Original Regular Papers and arXiv-based Submissions

We welcome both original research papers and submissions based on arXiv pre-prints.

- Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
  - AI inference and training infrastructure
  - Resource-efficient AI algorithms
  - HW-SW co-design for generative AI
  - AI systems safety and trustworthiness
  - Formal methods for AI systems
  - Data management systems for generative AI
  - OS/networking/scheduling/storage/cluster management/comp architecture for AI systems
  - Other topics relevant to the design, implementation, and deployment of generative AI systems

### Submission Guidelines

#### General Guidelines
- All submissions must be original and not under review elsewhere.
- Submissions should clearly articulate the problem being addressed, the proposed solution, and its relevance to generative AI systems.

#### Original Papers
- Limit: 5 pages, excluding references.
- Format: [ACM LaTeX template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template).
- Reviewing: Single-blind.

#### arXiv-based submissions
- Encouraged length: <= 14 pages (but not required).
